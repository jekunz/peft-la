Training script for language adapters. Slightly modified from [this script](https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapters/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py). 

This example is for *jekunz/lora1024attn*. For other setups, the *adapter_config* in *run_clm_adapters.py* and the arguments in *run_clm_adapters.sh* are to be modified.
